**Real-Time Anomaly Detection 🚀**

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in real time using data streaming and machine learning techniques. It continuously monitors incoming data, identifies unusual patterns, and flags potential anomalies instantly. The repository contains the complete implementation along with supporting files and a project presentation PPT.

**📌 Features**
⚡ Real-time data ingestion and monitoring

🤖 Machine learning–based anomaly detection

📊 Visualization of detected anomalies

🛠️ Modular and scalable code structure

📁 Includes full source code, dataset (if applicable), and PPT presentation


**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python (or update if different)

Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (if used)

Real-Time Processing:
Kafka / Socket Streaming / Real-time API (update based on your project)

Visualization:
Matplotlib / Plotly / Dash

**🚀 Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Project
python main.py


If you’re using streaming (Kafka / Socket), start the data stream before running the detection script.

**🎯 How It Works**

Collects live data stream or real-time input

Preprocesses and normalizes incoming data

Applies anomaly detection model / algorithm

Flags anomalies and visualizes output in real time

Logs detected anomalies for further analysis

**📌 Use Cases**

Fraud Detection

Intrusion & Cybersecurity Monitoring

IoT Sensor Fault Detection

Financial Market Monitoring

Healthcare / Patient Monitoring
